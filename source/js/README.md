# Javascript

Each file in the **/source/js** directory will be concatenated into a single **/public/js/scripts.js** file.

Please use multiple files rather than stuffing all javascript into a single file.


## Validation

[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is being used to validate javascript.

The grunt task ``grunt eslint`` can be used to easily validate all javascript.
