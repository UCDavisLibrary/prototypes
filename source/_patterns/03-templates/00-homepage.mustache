			<p>Maynard Amerine, a professor of viticulture and enology at UC Davis for nearly four decades, is widely considered to be the driving force behind the post-Prohibition wine industry in California. The over 5,000 labels he collected tell a story of the global wine industry from the 1800s through the 1950s.</p>
			<p>The Amerine wine label collection provides a meaningful window into the history of both winemaking and winemakers during a pivotal time in the industry. Our goal is to make these labels, and this history, searchable and accessible to wine lovers everywhere.</p>
			<p>To accomplish this, we need help marking, transcribing and describing the labels to create a searchable database. That’s where you come in! Help us uncork a piece of history.</p>

					<h1>Here's how you can help:</h1>
					<h2>Mark</h2>
					<div class="row">
						<p class="small-12 medium-6 columns">The first thing we need is to mark the areas on each label that will eventually need transcribing or describing.</p>

					</div>
					<h2>Transcribe & Describe</h2>
					<div class="row">
						<p class="small-12 columns">Once all the areas of interest on a label have been marked, we need to figure out what they actually say. For that, we need you to transcribe and describe:</p>
						<img class="small-12 medium-6 columns step-image" src="../../images/image-step-2.png" alt="Animated depiction of step 1: marking an area on a label"/>
						<p class="small-12 medium-6 columns">Transcribe the text or handwriting on each label as accurately as you can.  Use your best judgement when deciding whether to use capital letters, or when trying to decipher Amerine’s handwriting.</p>
						<p class="small-12 medium-6 columns">or write a description for the images that have been marked by other people. Again, use your best judgement—there is no wrong answer!</p>

			<p>Until the labels are transcribed and a searchable database created, they’re just ordered randomly. That’s why we need your help. As more labels are transcribed, we’ll be able to gather more information about them. That will help us organize how we present them to you.</p>
			<p>In the meantime, you can browse through the labels at random below. <a href="FIXME add link to Mailchimp">Sign up for our newsletter</a> to be notified when stories about the labels and the ability to search the database become available.</p>
