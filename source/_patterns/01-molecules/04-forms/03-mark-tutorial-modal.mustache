		<h2>How to Mark this label</h2>
		<p>Before we can transcribe the labels, we need to know which sections need transcription.</p>
		<p>You can help us by marking up the labels â€” draw a box around each area of interest on the label, and log it as an image or as a piece of text. Mark as many areas as you want.</p>
		<p>Try to keep phrases or groups of words that look like they belong together in one box.</p>
