  	"long": "<p>Pat delights in peering over the shoulders of UC Davis researchers as they do fascinating things and then in figuring out how to tell the world about it.</p> <p>Once convinced she was headed for veterinary school, she instead snagged an English degree in 1977 from UC Davis and headed out to become a small-town newspaper reporter. After six years of writing about school board meetings, almond harvests and local gourmets, she brought that deep knowledge base back to UC Davis.</p> <p>And sure enough, she did slip into vet school â€“ side door and up the stairs, equipped with a pen rather than a scalpel.  She now writes about and encourages news media coverage of both the School of Veterinary Medicine and the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, especially in the areas of agriculture, animal health, food science and nutrition, and biotechnology.</p>"
