			&lt;h1&gt;Label This&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The labels in the Maynard Amerine Collection at the UC Davis Libary tell the story of the growing wine industry in California. Many of them are meaningful windows into the fabric of both winemaking and winemakers and should be searchable in a way that accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Before we can create a searchable database, we need to transcribe the labels. That&rsquo;s where you come in! Help us uncork a piece of history.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h2&gt;Just want to look at the pretty labels?&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since the labels aren&rsquo;t transcribed yet, they&rsquo;re just ordered randomly. That&rsquo;s why we need your help. As we transcribe more labels, we&rsquo;ll be able to gather more information about them. That will help us organize how we present them to you.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you can browse through the labels at random below, or search for terms within the lables we&rsquo;ve transcribed so far.&lt;/p&gt;
