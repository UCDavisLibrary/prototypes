		&lt;h2&gt;How to Mark this label&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Before we can transcribe the labels, we need to know which sections need transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;You can help us by marking up the labels &mdash; draw a box around each area of interest on the label, and log it as an image or as a piece of text. Mark as many areas as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Try to keep phrases or groups of words that look like they belong together in one box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
